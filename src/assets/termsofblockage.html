        <h1>Terms of Blockage</h1>
        <p>Master Trackers is most embedded in keeping its user-base safe against threats. Considering most of our
            user-base is children and family, it is essential to block attacks and follow country regulations. To keep
            our user-base safe, we have different types of bans/blockages that we can apply to the user. These bans
            include <b>site-given blocks</b> and <b>Coudflare blocks</b></p>
        <p><strong>Types of Website Blocks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate Limits - <span class="highlight">If you send too many requests to the website you will automatically be blocked for any time between 10 minutes and 1 year.</span></li>
            <li>Country Regulations - <span class="highlight">considering this website is for kids, we have been requested by specific countries to ban access to our website. </span></li>
            <li>IP Ban - <span class="highlight">Your IP has been blocked for anything from suspicious activity to innapropriate chats.</span></li>
            
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Types of Coudflare Bans:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate Limits - <span class="highlight">Incase I didn't catch it, cloudflare will automatically block you for overusing the website.</span></li>
            <li>Known Attacks - <span class="highlight">Coudflare bans IP addresses known for attacking, hacking, spamming, etc. towards certain websites. You will be automatically blocked for any of these.</span></li>
            <li>Browser or User-Agent Issues - <span class="highlight">Coudflare will block an incoming request if you are using a browser/user-agent that has validity or reliability issues.</span></li>
            <li>VPN/Proxy Usage - <span class="highlight">You may be blocked for using a VPN/Proxy as it is against the rules of many websites. It can also lead to anonymous attacks.</span></li>
            <li>Country Blockage - <span class="highlight">Some countries will request me to block access, so I may block via cloudflare.</span></li>
            <li>IP Reputation - <span class="highlight">Multiple other websites may report your IP of illegal attempts of access, therefor requiring a block.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may be automatically unblocked in the future.</p>
