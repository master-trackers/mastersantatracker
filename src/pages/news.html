        <p>So today, I am doing another test. I just released another version and this version has a ton of new features
            that I am really excited about. I completely restructured the tracker from scratch. I'm going for a dark
            aesthetic this time which is different from the previous white-themed pages. Heres some Beta systems
            information:

        <div class="title">Shutdown of Big Tracker</div>
        <div class="metadata">Published on April 6, 2024 at 12:00 PM</div>
        <p>Recently, as you may know, tebcc (track.easterbunny.cc) shut down, which was very unfortunate. Due to costs,
            his system was very hard to run, therefor, brings the shutdown of his software. It was very unfortunate as
            he was my only competition and now he's gone. It's the worst feeling you can feel. To honor his system, in
            2025 we will be using his bunny image instead of our usual to honor him. It was such an honor watching tebcc
            grow, and now I'm inspired to create my own. This year was the second ever launch of mbt (master bunny
            trackers), and this year was the first public launch. It's sad to see tebcc go, but now we will rise. This
            program is growing fast, and has tons of moving parts. With version 0.5.0, we had implemented a lot of new
            features. Here is the 2024 systems information:
        </p>
        <h1>Year of 2024 Systems Information</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This year is being built on node.js and npm.</p>
            <p>To start, there are an estimated <span class="highlight">10656</span> main stops for the bunny this year.
            </p>
            <p>Santa Claus normally calls the Easter Bunny to wish good luck, except for 2022 and 2019.</p>
            <p>The Bunny is expected to launch from Easter Island at <span class="highlight">6 AM EST</span>.</p>
            <p>He will usually start preparations at <span class="highlight">4 AM EST</span>.</p>
            <p>This will be happening on <span class="highlight">March 30th, 2024</span>.</p>
            <p>We updated a lot of things since this is the first year we are doing this system.</p>
            <p>To start, he will deliver to about <span class="highlight">8.1 billion people (8,100,000,000
                    people)</span>.</p>
            <p>This is solely based on radars and will estimate the next location from past years and radars. We are
                using Google satellites and NORAD radars.</p>
            <p>Our system can be found on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>If you would like to record this, please note that you can add <span class="highlight">?zoom=1-15</span>
                at the end of <span class="highlight">/en-us/embed/map</span> or <span
                    class="highlight">/en-us/embed/tracker</span> to go directly to the map and zoom.</p>
            <p>This year is the first year for master bunny trackers to track the Easter Bunny, so sorry for any bugs.
            </p>
            <p>Should launch at <span class="highlight">8 am UTC</span>.</p>
            <p>Every year the Easter Bunny gets a series of tasks before it launches. For instance, last year he had to
                check every Easter egg which took about <span class="highlight">5 minutes</span>.</p>
            <p>He likes to travel at a pace of <span class="highlight">8 seconds per city</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">449.33</span> cities per hour.</p>
            <p>It is really unknown how fast he travels, although it is predicted he travels at millions of miles per
                hour.</p>
            <p>An average of <span class="highlight">800 thousand baskets per city</span>.</p>
